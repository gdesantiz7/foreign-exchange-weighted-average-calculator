# Foreign Exchange Weighted Average Calculator
A vast majority of trading in the foreign exchange market as well as many other markets is  considered high frequency trading (HFT), where transactions are executed by machines, allowing the process to be automated and the calculations to be made at a rapid rate on a great scale.  With this notion in mind, one foreign exchange trade is usually comprised of several other smaller trades all with different notional values and different prices.  To determine the total notional value of the base currency position and the average price, a weighted average formula must be  applied.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a basic weighted average function that with a little modification, can not only be used in foreign exchange but also many other asset classes as well.
