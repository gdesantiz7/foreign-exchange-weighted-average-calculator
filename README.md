# Foreign Exchange Weighted Average Calculator
A vast majority of trading in the foreign exchange market as well as many other markets are considered high frequency trading (HFT), where transactions are executed by machines, allowing the process to be automated and the calculations to be made at a rapid rate on a great scale.  With this notion in mind, one foreign exchange trade is usually comprised of several other smaller trades all with different notional values and prices.  To determine the total notional value of the base currency position and the average price, a weighted average formula must be applied.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a basic weighted average function that can not only be used in foreign exchange but also many other asset classes as well.

## Using the Foreign Exchange Weighted Average Calculator
First, import List from the typing library followed by holding shift and pressing enter.

Next, copy and paste the fx_weighted_average function into a cell and again hold shift and press enter.

If you would like to enter an amount over 100, please comment out the entire assert statement in the code block below (enter # next to each line) or change the constant 100 to the desired threshold.

In addition, amount represents 1,000,000 units.  If you would like to change the size, simply modify the constant value of 1,000,000 in the amounts_1_mio local variable.

Lastly, type fx_weighted_average() and within the parenthesis, enter two lists separated by a comma with one representing all the transacted amounts and the other with the corresponding prices.  Please note that each amount should be in the same order of the list as its associated price or the weights will be incorrect.

Using the provided example above, the output should look like this: 6,000,000 @ 1.11290

Trading and investing in the foreign exchange market involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.  The valuation of currencies and futures may fluctuate, and, as a result, you may lose more than your original investment.  The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.

If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account.
