In terms of Python syntax, `lots` is categorized as a list of integers, while `prices` is categorized as a list of floats.  `lots` are actually foreign exchange units which are converted into notionals of 1,000,000 each.  `prices` are foreign exchange prices that correspond to each lot.  The final output of this code is a summation of lots, at an average weighted price.  Please note that the length of lots must equal the length of prices.  In addition, each lot must be an integer between 1 and 100."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"5wW6qL1uTuz3"},"source":["## Import"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"edHpXYJlTuz4","colab":{}},"source":["from typing import List"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"9TNIfBHRTuz7"},"source":["## Function"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"cyXb75xCTuz8","colab":{}},"source":["def fx_weighted_average(lots: List[int], prices: List[float]) -> float:\n","    \"\"\"Calculates the weighted average price per currency\"\"\"\n","    assert len(lots) == len(prices), \"amounts list length must equal \" \\\n","    \"prices list length\"\n","    for lot in lots:\n","        assert 1 <= lot <= 100, \"a lot in lots must be between 1 \" \\\n","        \"and 100\"\n","    lots_1_mio = [lot * 1000000 for lot in lots]\n","    lots_by_prices = [a_i * p_i for a_i, p_i in zip(lots_1_mio, prices)]\n","    lots_sum = sum(lots_1_mio)\n","    lots_by_prices_sum = sum(lots_by_prices)\n","    print(f\"{format(lots_sum, ',')} at {format(lots_by_prices_sum / lots_sum, '0.5f')}\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"jGzcWPX0Tuz-"},"source":["## Output"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":382,"status":"ok","timestamp":1573158905993,"user":{"displayName":"Gregory DeSantis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCHssn6k_W39SXrih--NHbKlExO1GXsE0Yvse1A6n8=s64","userId":"13988622607574133301"},"user_tz":300},"id":"aQIawM9kTuz-","outputId":"ff9b38be-1bb0-4639-eb16-2752c9a4919e","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["fx_weighted_average([1,2,3],[1.1125,1.1128,1.1131]) # 6,000,000 at 1.11290"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["6,000,000 at 1.11290\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
