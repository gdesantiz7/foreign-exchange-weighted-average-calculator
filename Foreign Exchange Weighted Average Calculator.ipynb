In terms of syntax, amounts is categorized as a list of integers, while price is categorized as a list of floats.  Amounts are actually foreign exchange units which are converted into notionals of 1,000,000 each.  Prices are foreign exchange prices that correspond to each unit.  The final output of this code is a summation of amounts, at an average weighted price.  Please note that the length of amounts must equal the length of prices.  In addition, each amount must be an integer between 1 and 100."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5wW6qL1uTuz3"},"source":["## Import"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"edHpXYJlTuz4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638808868480,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":185,"user":{"displayName":"Gregory DeSantis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhfgiOHX-RDVNEJj8rSPrG1hgIlx8g86t1lYdXBW7s=s64","userId":"13988622607574133301"}}},"source":["from typing import List"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9TNIfBHRTuz7"},"source":["## Function"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cyXb75xCTuz8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638808868635,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Gregory DeSantis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhfgiOHX-RDVNEJj8rSPrG1hgIlx8g86t1lYdXBW7s=s64","userId":"13988622607574133301"}}},"source":["def fx_weighted_average(amounts: List[int], prices: List[float]) -> float:\n","    \"\"\"Calculates the weighted average price per currency\"\"\"\n","    assert len(amounts) == len(prices), \"amounts list length must equal \" \\\n","    \"prices list length\"\n","    for amount in amounts:\n","        assert 1 <= amount <= 100, \"a amount in amounts must be between 1 \" \\\n","        \"and 100\"\n","    amounts_1_mio = [amount * 1000000 for amount in amounts]\n","    amounts_by_prices = [a_i * p_i for a_i, p_i in zip(amounts_1_mio, prices)]\n","    amounts_sum = sum(amounts_1_mio)\n","    amounts_by_prices_sum = sum(amounts_by_prices)\n","    print(f\"{format(amounts_sum, ',')} @ {format(amounts_by_prices_sum / \\\n","                                                  amounts_sum, '0.5f')}\")"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jGzcWPX0Tuz-"},"source":["## Output"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aQIawM9kTuz-","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638808868637,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Gregory DeSantis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhfgiOHX-RDVNEJj8rSPrG1hgIlx8g86t1lYdXBW7s=s64","userId":"13988622607574133301"}},"outputId":"8c12fff3-9f62-4388-ecaa-fc3b0564036b"},"source":["fx_weighted_average([1, 2, 3],[1.1125, 1.1128, 1.1131])"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["6,000,000 @ 1.11290\n"]}]}]}
